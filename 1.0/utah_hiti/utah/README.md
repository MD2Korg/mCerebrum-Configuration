# MD2K Year 2 Smoking at Northwestern (STU00201566)

## Description
The purpose of this study is (1) to develop the decision rules and
evaluate the feasibility of a just-in-time intervention to delay or
prevent smoking relapse in smokers attempting to quit (2) to predict
the timing of lapses following a quit attempt (3) to develop a model
to detect single puff episodes of smoking using wrist-worn inertial
sensors.

The first hypothesis of this study is that the just-in-time stress
management intervention will lead to fewer lapses following a quit
attempt than a combination of cessation and stress management
counseling. The second hypothesis is that greater pre-quit emotional
and physiological disruption associated with quitting will predict
more rapid relapse.
